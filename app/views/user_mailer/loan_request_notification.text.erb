<%= @requester.name %> would like to borrow <%= @user_lacquer.lacquer.name %> from you.

Go to your profile page at <%= @user_url %> to respond to <%= @requester.first_name %>'s request.

If you choose to accept this request, you may set a due date for the loan (or not), and update this date at any time. We will send <%= @requester.first_name %> a notification that you've agreed to the loan and <%= @requester.first_name %> will be able to see the accepted loan and due date on their profile page.

Once the loan is accepted, getting <%= @user_lacquer.lacquer.name %> to your friend (and back to you) is up to you and <%= @requester.name %> to coordinate, though we'll notify <%= @requester.name %> of when the due date is coming up!

Have a great day,

Your Friends At Lacquer Love&Lend
